The recognized portion of an antigen.

A given antigen may have many epitopes corresponding to many different antibodies, T-cells, or B-cells.  

If an epitope is covered or altered, its corresponding recognizer may loose it's ability to recognize the antigen.

A typical epitope is 6-8 amino acids long.  Assuming a per-amino-acid length of 3.5 angstroms, that means 2.1 to 2.8 nm in length.
