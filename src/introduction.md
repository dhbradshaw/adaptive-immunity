# Introduction

## Vision

As humans, we have at least two intelligent, learning systems: our nervous system and our immune system.

First through nonverbal communication and then speech and the writing, we've learned to let our minds communicate with each other and tap into a larger body of knowledge than any one mind can find by itself.  But our immune systems remain feral, each immune system learning its own lessons like a child growing up without human or cultural contact.

This separation and the power of communication suggest that there is an enormous opportunity to improve the effectiveness of our immune systems and therefore of the human condition as a whole.

As we do so, we have reason to believe that we can more effectively combat and perhaps even more or less defeat an array of human challenges, including

- conquer infectious disease,
- cure cancer, and
- overcome autoimmune disease.

We can now read the memory of the immune system by reading out the genetic changes in the T and B cells in our blood, and we can do it quickly, for millions of cells at a time and cheaply, for perhaps 100 dollars per sample.  Now is the time to bring about this massive change in the effectiveness of the human immune system.
