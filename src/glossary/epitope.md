# Epitope

The recognized portion of an antigen.  Also called an \textit{anitgenic determinant}.

A given antigen may have many epitopes corresponding to many different antibodies.

If an epitope is covered or altered, its corresponding recognizer may loose it's ability to recognize the antigen.

## Size

A typical peptide epitope is 6-8 amino acids long.
Assuming a per-amino-acid length of 3.5 angstroms, that means that a typical epitope is from
`2.1` to `2.8` `nm` in length if it's stretched out in a line.

## Epitope Degeneracy

Considering only amino acid sequence differences (and therefore not, for example
tertiary structure or glycosylation related effects) and leaving out selenocysteine,
a length of `8` amino acids could have `9e18` different sequences.
